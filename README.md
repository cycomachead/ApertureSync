#ApertureSync

ApertureSync is a simple utility for keeping two [Aperture](http://www.apple.com/aperture) 
libraries in sync. The AppleScript is initial work at a simple GUI. Currently,
it's basis is rsync and it will probably remain that way even if I go native
Cocoa eventually...

Because it's rsync based I hope to expand options overtime to make more use of
rsync (ie bandwidth limiting).
